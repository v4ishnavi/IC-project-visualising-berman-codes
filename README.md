# IC-project-visualising-berman-codes
This project is the course project for the course Information and communication, 2023, UG1, Semester 2, IIIT-Hyderabad
Collaborators: Harshvardhan Pandey, Vaishnavi Shivkumar

This project entailed the development of visual aids using the Manim library in python to elucidate key concepts from the research paper "Berman Codes: A Generalization of Reed-Muller Codes that Achieve BEC Capacity." The focus was on creating intuitive, animated illustrations to simplify the complex mathematical and coding theory principles underlying Berman Codes. These visualizations effectively explain the preliminary concepts that go on to demonstrated how Berman Codes extend Reed-Muller Codes, offering insights into their capacity to achieve Broadcast Erasure Channel (BEC) capacity. 

This project was facilitated by Professor Prasad Krishnan.
